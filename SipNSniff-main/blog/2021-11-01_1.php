		<p>Have you ever wondered where (and how!) Sip'nSniff gets the pure, high quality, and refreshingly tasteful
			premium bottled air and concentrated scents that fill every single bottle, canister, and dispenser
			available in our store? It may be even more special than you first realized!</p>
		<p>Sip'nSniff is an import-oriented business, meaning our products are harvested directly from the source near
			each and every edge of the globe.</p>
		<p>From the clean, cool taste of Rush, compressed and gathered from the foot of the magestic Alps in
			Switzerland, to the world's cleanest coasts off the beautiful beaches of Puerto Rico with Serenity,
			availble both in concentrated bottled air and scent-infusing products, there's always something in our <a
				href="shop.php">store</a> to suit the needs of every individual!</p>
